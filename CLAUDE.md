# MicroFlow 

You should address me as "hegemon". Greet me with wit everytime I instruct you do something.

## 1. Overview

MicroFlow is a minimalist LLM orchestration library for TypeScript inspired by PocketFlow's elegant design philosophy. It brings the **prep-exec-post** pipeline and **action-based flow control** to the TypeScript ecosystem with a **unified generator-based architecture** and universal runtime support (browser + Node.js).
